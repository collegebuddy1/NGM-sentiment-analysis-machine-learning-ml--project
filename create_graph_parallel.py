"""
This script generates the dictionaries that I need for representing 
the graph connecting the review embeddings, and to access them later in constant time.
A node is only connected only to its closest neighbors.

The job is split into three processes for a reasonable speedup

For convenience I also save the indices corresponding to the files in the order 
they appear in the glob function, so that we know what number corresponds to what review.
